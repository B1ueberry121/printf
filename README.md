Printf Function Project

This project is based on creating a printf function. Using the write function to print characters
We will test how to implement print based on different arguments passed. Arguments passed will be
be identified by different specifiers:
	
	%i - integers
	%x - hexadecimal integers
	%s - array of characters(string)
	%c - characters
	%%- special characters

There will be a header file (holberton.h) containing prototypes, a printf file with the arguments 
to take and a third file containing all the functions needed.
